Lime Scooter Reversing 
=======================

## Description

I've been curious how these Scooters work, but to my suprise, I couldn't find any blogposts/repositories researching them, so I decided to create one myself. 

All information in this file has been collected from public online sources or real-life observations.

PRs are more than welcome.

### Trackers  
Spotted in the wild:

| Model         | Spotted on  |  
| ------------- | ----------- | 
| LBCAT-S-EU    | SJ2.5       |
| LBCATSL-EU_V02|             |
| LBCATSL-EU_V03|             |


Seems to share same internals as the `LBCAT-(H|B)`, minus keypad daughterboard.

Shows up as BLE device, with naming format `lime-XXXXXXXX` and OUI `18:62:E4 - Texas Instruments`.
Might be `CC2541`?
